<p> On June 2019 we launched FriquiFund Barcelona with the mission of supporting budding geeks (friquis) in developing their careers.</div>
<p><i>Friqui</i> means geek, in Spanish. For us it is a cheeky way to say: “people interested in pursuing careers in STEM”. FriquiFund members are all professionals related to the STEM world, willing to donate time and money to out mission.

        <div class="large text-muted"> Today we are more than 100 members and we have donated over 20,000€ to NGOs supporting young tech. students in need in Barcelona.</div>
